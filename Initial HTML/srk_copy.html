    <h3>Early Life And Family</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[7] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[8][9][b] According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Meer Jan Muhammad Khan, was originally from Afghanistan.[12][13][14] Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan (also known as Bacha Khan or the "Frontier Gandhi"), for independence of the Pashtuns from the British Raj.[15] Meer was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[16] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[17] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[18] Meer moved to New Delhi in 1948 after the partition of India.[19] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[20][c] His parents were married in 1959.[23] Khan described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[24] His paternal cousins in Peshawar claim that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan.[25][26]</p>
